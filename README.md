# Codex Remote Control

[中文 README](README.zh-CN.md)

Codex Remote Control is a small self-hosted bridge plus Android client for controlling Codex sessions from a phone on a private network.

The Linux/macOS host runs a Node.js WebSocket bridge. The Android app connects to that bridge, lists sessions, sends prompts, streams assistant output, handles approvals, and reads changed files or diffs from the active workspace.

This project is designed for personal/private-network use. It is not a hosted relay, multi-user service, or hardened public internet gateway.

## Features

- Thin Node.js bridge for `codex app-server --listen stdio://`
- Mock backend for local testing and Android UI development
- Token-protected WebSocket API
- Session list, start, resume, content snapshot, and incremental sync
- Streaming Codex events and approval request/response forwarding
- Session-scoped file reads for Android code and diff browsing
- Android client built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and OkHttp WebSocket

```

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for the component split and data flow.

## Quick Start

Install Node.js 20 or newer, Android Studio or a JDK-compatible Android build environment, and the Codex CLI on the bridge host.

```bash
npm install
npm run bridge
```

The bridge prints one or more URLs like:

```text
ws://192.168.1.10:8787/?token=...
```

By default the bridge stores its token, bridge id, state, and optional sync logs under `~/.config/codex_remote_control/`.

Create the local personal Android signing key once:

```bash
npm run apk:release:setup
```

Build the Android debug APK:

```bash
npm run apk
```

Install `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/codex-remote-control-v0.1.0-debug.apk`, open the app, and paste the bridge URL.
Debug and release APKs use the same local personal signing key, so they can share app data and replace each other after the first install with that key.

Build the Android release APK:

```bash
npm run apk:release
```

The release build outputs `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/codex-remote-control-v0.1.0-release.apk`.
It is signed with the local personal key under `android/release.keystore`.

More setup options are documented in [Usage](docs/usage.md).

## Development

Run bridge tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Compile Android Kotlin:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc && cd android && ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin
```

See [Development](docs/development.md) for repository layout, validation commands, and generated-code notes.

## Security

The bridge can control Codex sessions and approve local commands. Bind it only to a trusted private network, keep the token secret, and avoid exposing it directly to the public internet.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for supported reporting and deployment guidance.

## Q&A

### How should I solve networking between the phone and bridge host?

Codex Remote Control expects the Android app to reach your own bridge over a trusted network. For different locations, do not expose the bridge directly to the public internet. Prefer your own tunneling or private mesh/VPN setup, such as a reverse tunnel, WireGuard, Tailscale, ZeroTier, or another self-managed overlay network.
